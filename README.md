🏏 Third Umpire DRS System – Python Project

Third Umpire DRS System is a Python-based project that simulates the Decision Review System (DRS) used in cricket. It helps determine whether a batsman is out or not out using video analysis, ball tracking, and frame-by-frame replay. Perfect for learning Python, OpenCV, and sports analytics automation.

🚀 Features

🎥 Frame-by-frame video analysis

🏏 Simulates LBW and line decisions

⏱️ Slow-motion playback for precise review

✅ Determines Out or Not Out

🧩 Beginner-friendly Python project for sports tech

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

OpenCV (cv2) for video processing

imutils for frame handling

Tkinter (optional GUI)

OS & time modules for automation

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Third-Umpire-DRS-System.git


Navigate to the project directory

cd Third-Umpire-DRS-System


Install dependencies

pip install opencv-python imutils

▶️ How to Run
python main.py


Load a cricket video clip

Use the interface to mark key frames

The system simulates Out or Not Out decisions

Watch the replay with slow-motion effect

📌 How It Works

Video is loaded and processed frame by frame

Edge detection and motion tracking identify ball and bat

The system predicts trajectory and decision

Displays the decision (Out / Not Out) on screen

🔮 Future Enhancements

Automated LBW prediction using ML

GUI for user-friendly decision control

Integration with real match video feeds

Ball tracking and Hawk-Eye simulation

🎓 Use Cases

Cricket analytics and simulation

Python project for sports technology

College mini project or portfolio

Learn video processing and automation
